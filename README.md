# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-in-Java


Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic game that two people can enjoy together. It is played on a 3x3 grid where players take turns placing their marks, X or O, in empty spots. The main goal is to get three of the same marks in a row-horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

We are going to build a Java program that lets two players play the Tic-Tac-Toe game right from the console. There will be a board with numbers from 1 to 9, and we have to select a spot. And when it's our turn, we have to choose a number to put the mark there, and the board will update after every move, and the game continues until someone wins or it ends in a tie.

How to Play the Game
The steps to play the game are listed below:

Both players choose either X or O to mark their cells.
There will be a 3x3 grid with numbers assigned to each of the 9 cells.
The player who chooses X begins to play first.
He enters the cell number where he wishes to place X.
Now, both O and X play alternatively until one of the two wins.
Winning criteria: Whenever any of the two players has fully filled one row/ column/ diagonal with their symbol (X/ O), they win and the game ends.
If neither of the two players wins, the game is said to have ended in a draw.
